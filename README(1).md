#  Implementation of XGBoost Algorithm on IoT Network Traffic

Implemented XGBoost Algorithm on IoT Network 
Traffic. For this project Ba_IoT dataset was used.
In this dataset, there are total 9 devices.
So using XGBoost algorithm we have to detect
the traffic, generated by these devices are
malicious or Normal. For algorithm optimization 
two techniques were used. They are - PCA (Principal 
Component Analysis) and Pearson correlation 
coefficient.
## Objectives
    • Study of Boosting Algorithm and Implemented XGBoost on IoT traffic.

    • Increase accuracy and performance.

## Dataset used

The dataset that using is downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/detection_of_IoT_botnet_attacks_N_BaIoT. The dataset contain real traffic
data of 9 commercial IoT devices authentically infected by Mirai and Gafgyt.
## Algorithms used
    1. XGBoost Algorithm
## Methods used for Optimization and increasing Accuracy 

    1. PCA Technique

    2. Correlation Technique
