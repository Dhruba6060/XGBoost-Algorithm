# XGBoost-Algorithm
I implemented XGBoost Algorithm on IoT Network Traffic.
For this project I used Ba_IoT dataset. In this dataset, there are total 9 devices. So using XGBoost algorithm we have to detect the traffic, generated by these devices are malicious or not. For algorithm optimization I used two techniques. They are -  PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and Pearson correlation coefficient.
